## React-Router-dom
Note: This package provides the core routing functionality for React Router, 
but you might not want to install it directly. If you are writing an application 
that will run in the browser, you should instead install react-router-dom. Similarly, 
if you are writing a React Native application, you should instead install react-router-native. 
Both of those will install react-router as a dependency.
